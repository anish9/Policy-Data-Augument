### Data Augumentation as claimed in the paper [Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501)
The project has been build on top of [AutoAugment](https://github.com/DeepVoltaire/AutoAugment)

### USAGE
#### we need to have folder structure in similiar way

    ├── image_classifier_data
    ├── Apple                    
    │   ├── apple1.jpg          
    │   ├── apple2.jpg         
    │   └── apple3.jpg              
    ├── Orange                    
    │   ├── orange1.jpg          
    │   ├── orange2.jpg         
    │   └── ornage3.jpg          # Image directory structure (something similiar to classifier friendly structure) 
    └── ...
    
 
#### check the helps before execution
```
python3 build_dataset.py -h
usage: build_dataset.py [-h] -f FILES_DIRECTORY -r REPLICAS -p POLICY

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILES_DIRECTORY, --files_directory FILES_DIRECTORY
                        root image file directory containing classes and under
                        classes containing images
  -r REPLICAS, --replicas REPLICAS
                        number of times an image has to undergo policy
                        augumentations
  -p POLICY, --policy POLICY
                        available policies are svhn, imagenet, cifar, all


```
#### Running the code when all set (NOTE : augumented image files are saved on the same folder itself )
```
python3 build_dataset.py -f train_data/ -r 5 -p imagenet


```

#### To do
- [ ] Perceptual hasher to be added to remove context level duplicates
- [ ] Updates are welcome

#### About work
 - I deeply thank [DeepVoltaire](https://github.com/DeepVoltaire/AutoAugment) for creating Autoaugument and all the credits to be directed to him.
 - This repo has been created with more focus on to tackle data insufficiency problem, also easy to create a datset in seconds and experiment training (tensorflow, keras users friendly). 
 - Even if you have 15 images using the power of replica you can manipulate your data exponentially in seconds with respect to the policies paper from google research, read it for clarity.
 - Contributions are appreciated
